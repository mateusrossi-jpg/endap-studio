## Finding Louhi Logs for Gerrit Changes

When Continuous Integration (CI) is run by Louhi on Gerrit changes, results and logs can typically be accessed as follows:

1. **Navigate to the Gerrit Change:** Open the specific Change List (CL) in the Gerrit UI.

2. **Go to the "Checks" Tab:** If the host has the Treetop plugin enabled for Louhi integration, there will be a "Checks" tab on the Gerrit change page. This tab displays the status of various presubmit checks, including Louhi flows.

3. **Locate the Louhi Job:** Within the "Checks" tab, find the row corresponding to the Louhi presubmit flow you are interested in. Failing jobs will be highlighted (e.g., with a red icon).

4. **Access Execution Details:** Click on the link or button associated with the Louhi job to view more details. This link, often labeled something like "Details", "View Logs", or containing the flow name, will navigate you directly to the specific execution page within the Louhi UI.

5. **Analyze in Louhi:**
   - On the Louhi execution page, identify the failed stage(s) in the pipeline.
   - Click on the failed stage to expand it.
   - Look for tabs to the detailed logs, "Logs", which will often show an Open in Sponge button. This will take you to the markdown file of the logs.

**Miscellaneous Notes:**

- **Comments:** Louhi may also post comments directly on the Gerrit CL, summarizing results and providing direct links to the Louhi execution.
- **Labels:** Failing Louhi flows often result in a negative vote on a Gerrit label (e.g., Verified -1). The most reliable link to the logs will be in the Checks tab or comments.
- **Optional Tests:** CL's on Gerrit may fail tests labelled as optional. These tests do not block submission.
**Primary Path:** Gerrit Change -> "Checks" Tab -> Click on the specific Louhi presubmit job run -> Link to Louhi UI -> Find failed stage -> Logs tab -> Sponge link
